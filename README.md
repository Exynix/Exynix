# *Some info about me*
Hi there! Currently I'm a systems engineer student @Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogot√°. 

I'm a firm believer that questioning the "why" of things and deeply understanding a topic is way more valuable than just working towards an result, no matter how you get there. Grades and titles can only tell you so much about a person's values and principles.
